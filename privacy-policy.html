    <h4>Information You Provide to Us</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Nickname:</strong> We collect a player nickname that you voluntarily provide. This nickname is used to identify you on the public leaderboards. You are not required to use your real name.

        <li>
            <strong>Country Code:</strong> We collect the region code (e.g., "US", "ES") from your device's localization settings. We use this information solely to display your country's flag and to provide country-specific leaderboards. We **do not** collect your precise GPS location.
        </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Timestamp (`created_at`):</strong> Our database automatically records the date and time when a score is submitted. This is used for creating monthly and time-based leaderboards.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Futura Zone uses the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Service.</li>
        <li>To display your score, nickname, and country flag on global, national, and time-based leaderboards.</li>
        <li>To provide personalized advertising through our third-party partners.</li>
